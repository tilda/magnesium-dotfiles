- [`niri`](https://github.com/yalter/niri)
  - [`noctalia-shell`](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell)
  - [wallpaper](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/116190510) by Run_Rotary
- `fastfetch`
- `moonlight` (discord)
  - mostly for `nativeFixes` linux native updater
  - installed discord in user folder because client modding is incompatible with system installs basically
    - used [this script by @maddymeows](https://gist.github.com/maddymeows/6af1a5d5a870c13b7b159c4463edee70) to bootstrap
- 1password
  - modified .desktop file to make quick access work in KDE, still in the repo for now?


## todo

- write a hellish symlink script
  - or i might just do everything manually but i can never remember the order of `ln` to save my life
