i'm trying this arch linux thing again so here's the stuff i've been using so far. themed based off rice shower from umamusume

- `fastfetch`
- kde plasma
  - desktop & konsole themed using [catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) macchiato
- `moonlight` (discord)
  - mostly for linux native updater
  - installed discord in user folder because client modding is incompatible with system installs basically
    - used [this script by @maddymeows](https://gist.github.com/maddymeows/6af1a5d5a870c13b7b159c4463edee70) to bootstrap

## todo

- find some way to reasonably manage this without making a hellish symlink script
  - surely someone made it that easy, right?
